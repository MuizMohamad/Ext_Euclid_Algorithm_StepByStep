# Extended Euclid Algorithms Step By Step Working Generator

Just a fun side-project since doing the algorithm by hand is quite repetitive  

Insert the two number for the algorithm to run  
First it will run Euclid Algorithm to check its final remainder  
If the remainder is 1 then it will run Extended Euclid algorithm
